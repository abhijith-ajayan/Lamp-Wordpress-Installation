Installing and configuring Wordpress using Ansible playbook in RedHat and Debian based Distro's
=========

The infrastructure here includes one ansible master server and two ansible client servers(Ubuntu and Amazon linux). Ansible is installed in the Master server and using ansible playbook we will be installing and configuring Apache, MariaDB and Wordpress in the client servers.

Prerequisites:
---------

Install Ansible and verify the connection between Ansible server and client machine on which you need to automate tasks. Ansible can be installed using PIP or package manager.



Create roles for the tasks:
---------

Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. In this project i'm have created lamp role for installation and configuration of below the task. 

 * Install Apache webserver

* Install PHP

* Install MariaDB and Mysql database server

* Creating a user account and setting up document root for domain

 * Creating domain virtual host

Roles can be created using init command.

[root@ip-172-31-3-208 roles]# ansible-galaxy init lamp


These main tasks for lamp role are written to file lamp/tasks/main.yml

Adding handlers to playbook

Handlers are tasks that only run when notified. Handlers are used in this project to restart apache webserver whenever configuration of this service got changed by task, notifydirective is used for this. In the lamp/tasks/main.yml file you can see notify directive is used when ever those taks modify this service configuration. Regardless of how many tasks notify a handler, it will run only once, after all of the tasks completed in a playbook.

Handlers tasks are written to lamp/handlers/main.yml file

Conclusion
----------

Using the steps in this document i have setup lamp and deploy wordpress on ubuntu and amazon-linux using ansible playbook. Using ansible we can run the tasks on mulitple targets server, it will be easy, error free and saves much time when compared to performing this setups manually in multiple target servers.
